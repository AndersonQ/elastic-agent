- Delve, a debugger for Go
- Delve GUIs - VSCode and Goland
- Using a debugger: the easy way - "hit the debug button"
- Compiling Go for better debug (keep debug symbols, no inlining/optimisations, trimpath)
- using delve:
- compile/run with delve
- compile with Go, run with delve
- ensure the source code is available to delve / avoid "no source available" issue
- Debugging with delve:
- set/show/delete/list breakpoints
- continue, next, step into code, step over code
- read/watch variables and arguments
- change variables values
- execute an expression
- goroutines: list and switch to desired goroutine
- Debugging running programs:
- attach to a already running program
- remote debug - VM and docker:
- headless for dlv connect and Goland
- dap for VSCode
- using delve to run the binary + connect from another machine
- use delve start a headless backend and attach to a running process + connect from a remote client
